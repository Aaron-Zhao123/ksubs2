// Kiwi Scientific Acceleration Example - Lower/Upper Decomposition and Equation Solving.
// (C) 2014 DJ Greaves, University of Cambridge, Computer Laboratory.
//
//  Simultaneous Equations Solving using L/U decomposition. 
//  This is the single-threaded version.  
//  Parallel speedup is gained here through automatic unwind of the inner loops.
//  An explictly parallel implementation is in another demo.
